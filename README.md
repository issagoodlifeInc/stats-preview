## Overview

### The challenge

 - Build the Stats preview card component making it look close to the designs given for mobile and laptop as I possibly can. Let's do itüëäüèæüòâ

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

Preview of mobile view of card ...didn't know how to effectivly deal with the margins and width of the divs used ...

## My process
  #started with the HTML markup of the stat card
  Completed the html this time not using span too much as compared to previous solutions

  #Then dealt with css first declaring variables used for the colors provided for the projects
  Designed in desktop view first then mobile responsive last
  Used too much @media in this project which is not ideal ....üòÖ Help here if you can please ..Did't know how to deal with the widths and margins properly

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow üíØ

### What I learned

How to capitalize with css
Added quite a bit of grid knowledge

Know this is too much medias , If you know what can help shorten ,your input will be much appreciated, see below:


```css
@media (max-width:635px){
  section{
  margin: 8% 5%;
  }
  .stat-image img{
    width: auto;
  }
}
@media (max-width:583px){
  section{
  margin: 8% 3%;
  }
  .stat-image img{
    width: auto;
  }
}
@media (max-width:567px){
  section{
    margin: 8% 12%;
  }
   .insights{
    width: 300px;
  }
  .stat-image{
    width: 370.4px;
    height: 305.917px;
  }
  .stat-image img{
    width: 370.4px;
    height: auto;
  }
}
@media (max-width:447px){
  section{
    margin: 8% 6%;
  }
}
@media (max-width:419px){
  .stat-image img{
    width: 270.4px;
  }
  .stat-image{
    width: 270.4px;
    height: 223.333px;
  }
  .insights{
    width: 200px;
  }
  section{
    margin: 8% 16%;
  }
}
```
